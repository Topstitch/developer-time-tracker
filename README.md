#Developer Time Tracker

This app will help developers in an organization track time spent on various projects.  A developer can log in and enter hours that they worked on certain projects.  They can see a list of the other developers on the team, and a list of current projects.  If a developer is on overtime, or if a project is over the budgeted hours, there are various warnings.
